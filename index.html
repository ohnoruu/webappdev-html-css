<!--
Assignment: replicate the portion of team8521.com that states:
Weâ€™re a robotics team in Westminster, California
founded in 2020 as a non-profit. Team 8521 focuses on diversity, inclusion, and provide our members hands-on opportunities to practice real engineering and marketing.

The html file should be split into 3 sections/divs:
"container" - contains everything in the HTML document, including "img-section" and "text-section", which are nested divs. 
"img-section" - contains the image that is displayed alongside the text
"text-section" - contains the text displayed alongside the image. 

Hint: start by defining an <h1> and <p> element. What should go in each in order to replicate the portion of the website properly?

Once you've replicated the portion of the website properly and have gotten familiar with different HTML and CSS elements, feel free to add your own personal changes.
